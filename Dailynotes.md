### I will write some notes related to my projects and challenges here just to keep myself accountable.

Just wrote simple [text encoder](https://github.com/DummyKen/30daysPython/blob/main/code_generator.py).

#### 27/11/21
Wrote a very inefficient program that is supposed to convert the units of length,weight,temperature but it doesn't unfortunately.
